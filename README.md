This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Image component where images with special characters in their URIs fail to load without any console errors. The bug.js file shows the problematic code, and bugSolution.js offers a solution using encodeURIComponent to properly encode the URI before passing it to the Image component.  This issue impacts developers using dynamic image URIs, particularly those derived from user inputs or external APIs. The solution ensures robust handling of various URI formats.
